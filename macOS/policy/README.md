# Device Control for macOS Policy

Contains information and resources for creating and validating Device Control for macOS policy json.

## Samples

The [samples](samples/README.md) directory contains a variety of example device control policies.



### Policy Schema

The Device Control Policy schema is defined in [device_control_policy_schema.json](./device_control_policy_schema.json).  This schema can be used to validate device control policies prior to deployment.

## groups / rules

Contains 'translations' of the existing Device Control for Windows examples found in [Group Policy](/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples/Group%20Policy/).  The file names (normalized) correspond to existing files within that location.

The translation is best effort as macOS only supports a subset of the existing functionality of the Windows implementation.

_Note: These json files are not valid Device Control for macOS policy files._
